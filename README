The project involves simulating genome assembly which is like finding the shortest common superstring (S) of a given set of strings (s1, s2â€¦ sn). The superstring S is known as a contig of the Genome and the set of strings being the short sequence reads churned out of the sequencing machines. This problem is shown to be NP-hard but there are several heuristic algorithms. 

The popular software programs doing assembly are Phrap (http://www.phrap.org/), MIRA (http://chevreux.org/projects_mira.html), Sequencher (http://www.genecodes.com/), AMOS (http://amos.sourceforge.net), Celera Assembler (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgs-assembler), Arachne (http://www.broad.mit.edu/wga/), DNA Baser (http://www.dnabaser.com/) and Newbler (http://www.454.com/enabling-technology/the-software.asp) and for manual correction - visualization such as Consed (http://bozeman.mbt.washington.edu/consed/consed.html) and Hawkeye (http://amos.sourceforge.net/hawkeye/).
